# Dispenserfarm Mod Introduction

Dispenserfarm is a lightweight yet powerful Minecraft mod that enhances dispensers, turning them into versatile tools for automated farming. This mod allows dispensers to plant a wide variety of crops and items, from wheat, carrots, and potatoes to unique plants like mushrooms, sugar cane, cave vines, and Nether Wart, using their corresponding items.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Planting**: Dispensers can place seeds, saplings, flowers, and other plantable items on suitable surfaces like farmland, soul sand, or nylium.
- **Wide Crop Support**: Supports basic crops, tall flowers (e.g., sunflowers, lilacs), mushrooms, sugar cane, and special plants like Nether Wart and cave vines.
- **Optimized Bone Meal Use**: Bone meal accelerates Nether Wart growth, produces glow berries on cave vines, and boosts sugar cane development, with visual particle effects on success. Notably, the mod disables sound and smoke effects when bone meal is not used, ensuring a seamless experience.
