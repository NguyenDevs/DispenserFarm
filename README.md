# Dispenserfarm Mod Introduction

Dispenserfarm is a lightweight yet powerful Minecraft mod that enhances dispensers, turning them into versatile tools for automated farming. This mod allows dispensers to plant a wide variety of crops and items, from wheat, carrots, and potatoes to unique plants like mushrooms, sugar cane, cave vines, and Nether Wart, using their corresponding items.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Planting**: Dispensers can place seeds, saplings, flowers, and other plantable items on suitable surfaces like farmland, soul sand, or nylium.
- **Wide Crop Support**: Supports basic crops, tall flowers (e.g., sunflowers, lilacs), mushrooms, sugar cane, and special plants like Nether Wart and cave vines.
